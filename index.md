# Projects
These are some projects which I have done that I want you to know that I have done.

# [Patterns in life's use of major enzymatic reaction classes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dgagler/dgagler/blob/master/enzyme_demo.ipynb)

**Data retrieval, cleaning, analysis, and visualization in python.** I study large patterns in biology, aiming to uncover "laws of life". In many ways, life is a chemical process. And what makes biology unique, and in fact, allows it to exist at all, is it's ability to circumvent abiotic or "non-living" chemical reaction rates. Speeding up reactions is the main function of enzymes, which are essential to life's ability to function. Enzymes, being the functional workhorse of life, are poorly understood in the broader context of life. This project aims to create a bird's eye view of enzymes in biology by utilizing public genome and biochemical databases.

# [Microbial Exploration of Spirea Creek, Yellowstone National Park](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dgagler/dgagler/blob/master/spirea_sequencing_demo.ipynb)

**Microbiological fieldwork, DNA extraction and PCR amplification, sequence analysis and taxonomic classification using QIIME 2, and data visualization in python.** Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is one of the premier locations to study the intersection of geochemistry and microbiology. For this project, I collected microbial samples from a set of previously uncharacterized geochemical hot springs in YNP. DNA was extracted from these samples, amplified via PCR, and subsequently sequenced. I analyzed the sequence data using QIIME 2 and visualized the results using python. This project explores the microbiology of diverse hot spring ecosystems.
